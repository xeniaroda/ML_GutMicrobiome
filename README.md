# ML_GutMicrobiome
This repository contains the code for a taxonomic, pathway abundance and gene family abundance analysis from different metagenomic programs and a main script that trains different models from different ML approaches to discriminate between control and diseased patients. It also contains a script that takes as input the microbiome profile of a sample and the generated models.
